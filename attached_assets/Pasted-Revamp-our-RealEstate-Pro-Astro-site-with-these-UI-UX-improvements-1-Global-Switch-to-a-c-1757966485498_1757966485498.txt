Revamp our RealEstate Pro Astro site with these UI/UX improvements:

1. Global
   • Switch to a clean, modern color palette (e.g. deep navy, soft gray, accent teal).
   • Use a sticky, transparent navbar that transitions to a solid background on scroll.
   • Standardize typography: a bold sans-serif for headings and a friendly serif or sans-serif for body text.
   • Ensure full mobile responsiveness with Tailwind CSS classes.

2. Hero Section
   • Replace static header with a full-width background image or subtle video loop of Houston neighborhoods.
   • Overlay the headline and subhead with a semi-opaque card or gradient fade for legibility.
   • Center a prominent CTA button (“Search Properties” or “Start Your Search”) below the tagline.

3. Property Search
   • Convert the search form into a single, compact horizontal card with dropdowns and a “Search” button.
   • Add icons inside each input (e.g. home icon for type, dollar icon for price).
   • Use a light shadow and rounded corners to make it pop against the page background.

4. Featured Listings
   • Display featured properties in a responsive grid (2–3 cards per row on desktop, 1 on mobile).
   • Each card should include: property image, price badge, address, key stats (beds/baths/area), and a “View Details” button.
   • Add hover effects (scale up image, reveal quick-view button).

5. Trust & Social Proof
   • Under featured listings, insert a “Why Choose Us” section with 3–4 benefit icons (e.g. ★★★★★ reviews, local expertise, bilingual service).
   • Include a rotating testimonial slider or short client quotes.

6. Contact / Get Started
   • Simplify the “Get In Touch” form into a two-column layout on desktop (form + agency photo or map) and single-column on mobile.
   • Label CTA clearly (“Let’s Talk,” “Request a Consultation”).
   • Add optional WhatsApp or Messenger chat icon floating in the bottom corner.

7. Footer
   • Expand footer into four columns: Brand info + logo, Quick Links, Contact Info, Social & Signup.
   • Use clear headings, smaller link list, and include a newsletter signup field.
   • Add copyright notice and a “Powered by Astro + Tailwind” badge.

8. Assets & Placeholder Content
   • Use Unsplash-sourced placeholder images for properties.
   • Add realistic dummy text for listing details and testimonials.
   • Keep all HAR widget placeholders intact for later swap-in.

Deliver this entirely in Tailwind-styled Astro components, ensuring each section is modular and easily adjustable.

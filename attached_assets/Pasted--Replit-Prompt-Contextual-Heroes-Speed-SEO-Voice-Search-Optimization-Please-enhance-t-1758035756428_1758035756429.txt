### 🚀 Replit Prompt: Contextual Heroes + Speed, SEO & Voice-Search Optimization

Please enhance the project with these final requirements before launch:

1. Contextual Hero Sections  
   - Home: keep suburban-Houston image + dark overlay + “Search Properties” CTA  
   - Services: swap to “agent consulting client” photo + same overlay + “Our Services” heading  
   - Contact: swap to warm office or Houston map-pin graphic + same overlay + “Get In Touch” form  

2. Image Optimization for Performance  
   - Convert all hero and listing images to modern formats (WebP/AVIF) with JPG fallbacks  
   - Generate responsive `<picture>`/`srcset` variants for desktop, tablet, mobile  
   - Add explicit width/height attributes and lazy-load non-critical images  
   - Compress assets (under 100 KB hero images) and serve via CDN or Astro’s image pipeline  

3. Text & Markup for SEO  
   - Use semantic HTML: one `<h1>` per page, structured `<h2>`/`<h3>` for sections  
   - Write concise, keyword-rich headlines and subheads (e.g. “Houston Bilingual Realtor” + locale)  
   - Populate meta title, description, and Open Graph tags for each page  
   - Add local-business schema (JSON-LD) with Mr. Sold’s name, address, phone, license, service area  

4. Voice-Search Readiness  
   - Include an FAQ section with 4–6 question-answer pairs using natural language (e.g. “How do I request a CMA in Houston?”)  
   - Mark FAQs with FAQPage schema (JSON-LD)  
   - Sprinkle long-tail, conversational phrases in headings and body copy (e.g. “Where can I find bilingual realtors in Cypress?”)  

5. Verification & Testing  
   - Run Lighthouse audit: aim for 90+ performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO  
   - Test mobile speed and voice-search retrieval in native assistant emulators  
   - Confirm all images load quickly, text is crawlable, and FAQ answers appear in Rich Results previews  

Deliver these optimizations while preserving Tailwind utilities, existing layout, and HAR widget placeholders.
